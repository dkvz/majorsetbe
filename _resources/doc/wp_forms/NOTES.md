# WP Forms for the contact form
I'm going to use the WP forms extension to create the contact form.

Documenting my steps:
- Clicked the button "creating a simple contact form".
- I'm using the default fields, you can add a short description at the top but it seems to be ignored when adding the form to a new page.

-> Create the Contact page, WP Forms should ask you to.

I then use Gutenberg to manually add a small description on top of the page.

**YOU SHOULD OBVIOUSLY TEST THE FORM**

## Styling
- Go into WP Forms settings, and enable only "base styles".

-> I then created a new folder and style file in sass/plugins.
